## About
WarpDrive is a general purpose KV/Object store focused on workloads that require high throughput. Practical Applications which drives our developemt is to support Storage Disaggregated Architectures and AI/ML training Workloads . Our current implementation of the object store is based on Facebook's 2008 haystack paper and our road map([Technical Roadmap](https://github.com/vitality-ai/Storage-service/blob/main/docs/Technical-Roadmap.md)) for our future versions will be driven by the next generation's storage needs with solid fundamental understanding of the history of these storage systems with a product first design. [ v1.0.0 Technical Architecture](https://github.com/vitality-ai/Storage-service/blob/main/docs/Technical-Architecture.md). 

## System Offerings that are currently being built. 
1. Storage - Key/Value, Files and Blobs. 
2. Fault Tolerance - Uses Erasure Coding to Optimise Data replication - Seeks contribution for design - [Discussion](https://github.com/cia-labs/Storage-service/issues/72)
3. User Access Management and S3 middleware - [Repo](https://github.com/vitality-ai/Vitality-console)
4. Search - Seeks contribution for design. -   [Discussion](https://github.com/cia-labs/Storage-service/issues/35)
5. Availability - Seeks contribution for design. [Discussion]()
6. Client Library - Client package is currently available for Python only. [Repo](https://github.com/vitality-ai/python-sdk).
7. Compute and Storage Infrastructure Research - [Repo](https://github.com/vitality-ai/NexCSAD).
